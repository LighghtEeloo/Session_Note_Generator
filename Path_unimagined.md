## Sample Note with Annotation

The student came in with her critical response required by Matt. She argued that Alison's theory, which applies Christianity theories to explain the core idea of doppelganger is not well-established. However, her core thesis lacks her own opinion, and little does it present its stake. I asked her in detail how to polish Alison's article, and it turns out she want's to apply modern psychology theories to reexplain gothic fiction work. Since her original idea is hard to improve, we raised a new theory to explain the divided-self, which is the abstraction of the individual-society relation. After the discussion, the student found her way to a workable critical response framework.
